wd_identify \- get watchdog driver identity
.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB [ \-c " \fIfilename\fR|" \-\-config\-file " \fIfilename\fR]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility opens
.IR /dev/watchdog
and gets the identification string from the watchdog which then is printed. The
device is closed afterwards.
.PP
An exit code of zero indicates success in getting the driver identity, while a
non-zero exit code indicates an error (not configured in the config file, no
device driver loaded, or driver failed to respond to ioctl request).
.PP
The wd_identify tool can only be used without causing a reboot if your kernel
is compiled with the
.I CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
option enabled.
.PP 
Watchdog and/or wd_keepalive may have to be stopped to make sure that
wd_identify can access the watchdog device.
