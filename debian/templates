_Description: Start watchdog at boot time?
 Please specify whether watchdog should be started as part of the boot
 process. This can be changed later by editing /etc/default/watchdog.

Template: watchdog/restart
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Restart watchdog on upgrades?
 If your kernel is configured with the CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT option,
 restarting watchdog will cause a spurious reboot (the kernel will think
 the watchdog daemon crashed).
