Description: System health checker that also trigger kernel watchdogs
 The watchdog program writes to /dev/watchdog every ten seconds.  If
 the device is opened but not written to within a minute, the machine
 will reboot. This feature is available when the kernel is built with
 'software watchdog' support (standard in Debian kernels).
 .
 The ability to reboot will depend on the state of the machine
 and interrupts if the kernel software watchdog is used.
 .
 The watchdog tool itself runs several health checks and acts accordingly if
 the system is not in a good shape.
