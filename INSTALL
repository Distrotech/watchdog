If you're on a Debian system, make -f debian/rules binary creates the
watchdog package. It's even easier if you use debmake, just call build.
(Note that the Debian files are not distributed with the original source
anymore. You have to get the Debian .diff.gz file, too.)

In case you do not use Debian, consider switching to Debian :-)

If your Linux distribution does not include watchdog feel free to ask the
distributor to add it. Since watchdog is GPLed there should not be a
problem.

Okay, if you want to install it manually:

1) Edit the Makefile, if you have to. Note, that you can disable keep alive
   support and temperature checking by not providing a device name in the
   Makefile. However, you may still re-enable it at run time by giving the
   corresponding commandline option. If you enable temperature checking or
   keep alive support without having the corresponding device you will get
   an error message every time watchdog is started. This message can be
   safely ignored, since watchdog will then disable temperature checking or  
   keep alive support and keep on working.

2) Run make install as root.

3) If you don't have the device execute 'mknod /dev/watchdog c 10 130' as
   root. This is done automatically by the post-installation script for
   Debian users. 

4) Edit your boot procedure to start /usr/sbin/watchdog at boot time. The
   Debian bootfile is included in rc.watchdog.

That's it.

Enjoy
