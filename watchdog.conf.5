.TH WATCHDOG.CONF 5 "September 1998"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
watchdog.conf \- configuration file for watchdog.8
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file carries all configuartion option for the Linux software watchdog.
Each option has to be written on a line for itself. Comments start with '#'.
Blanks are ignored except after the '=' sign. An empty text after the '='
sign disables the feature as long as that makes sense.

.SH OPTIONS
Available  options are the following:
.TP
interval = <interval>
Set the interval between two writes to the softdog device. The kernel
drivers expects a write command every minute. Otherwise the system will be
rebooted. Default value is 10 seconds. An interval of more than a minute can
only be used with the -f commandline option.
.TP
logtick = <logtick>
If you enable verbose logging, a message is written into the syslog or a
logfile. While this is nice, it is not necessary to get a message every
10 seconds which really fills up disk and needs CPU. logtick allows adjustment
of the number of intervals skipped before a log message is written. If you
use logtick = 60 and interval = 10, every 10 minutes (600 seconds) is a
message written. This may make the exact time of a crash harder to find but
greatly reduces disk usage and administrator nerves if you're looking for a
particular syslog entry in between of watchdog messages.
.TP
max-load-1 = <load1>
Set the maximal allowed load average for a 1 minute span. Once this load
average is reached the system is rebooted. Default value is 0. That means
the load average check is disabled. Be careful not to this parameter too
low. To set a value less then the predefined minimal value of 2, you have to
use the -f commandline option.
.TP
max-load-5 = <load5>
Set the maximal allowed load average for a 5 minute span. Once this load
average is reached the system is rebooted. Default value is 3/4*max-load-1.
Be careful not to this parameter too low. To set a value less then the
predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use the -f commandline option.
.TP
max-load-15 = <load15>
Set the maximal allowed load average for a 15 minute span. Once this load
average is reached the system is rebooted. Default value is 1/2*max-load-1.
Be careful not to this parameter too low. To set a value less then the
predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use the -f commandline option.
.TP
min-memory = <minpage>
Set the minimal amount of virtual memory that has to stay free. Note that
this is in pages. Default value is 0 pages which means this test is
disabled. The pagesize is taken from the system include files.

max-temperature = <temp>
Set the maximal allowed temperature. Once this temperature is reached the
system is halted. Default value is 120. There is no unit conversion. So make
sure you use the same unit as your hardware. Watchdog will issue warnings
once the tempearture increases 90%, 95% and 98% of this temperature.
.TP
watchdog-device = <device>
Set the watchdog device name. Default is disable keep alive suppport.
.TP
temperature-device = <temp-dev>
Set the temperature device name. Default is disable temperature checking.
.TP
file = <filename>
Set file name for file mode.

Note that this option can be given as often as you like to check several
files.
.TP
change = <mtime> Set the change interval time for file mode. This options
always belongs to the active filename, that is when finding a ´change =´
line watchdog assumes it belongs to the most recently read ´file =´ line.
They don't neccessarily have to follow each other directly. But you cannot
specify a 'change =' before a 'file ='.

The default is to only stat the file and don't look for changes.
.TP
pidfile = <pidfilename>
Set pidfile name for server test mode.

Note that this option can be given as often as you like to check several
servers.
.TP
ping = <ip-addr>
Set IP address for ping mode

This option also can be used more often than once to check different
connections.
.TP
interface = <if-namer>
Set interface name for network mode

This option also can be used more often than once to check different
interfaces.
.TP
test-binary = <testbin>
Execute the given binary to do some user defined tests.
.TP
repair-binary = <repbin>
Execute the given binary in case of a problem instead of shutting down the
system.
.TP
admin = <mail-address>
Email address to send admin mail to. That is, who shall be notified that the
machine is being halted or rebooted. Default is 'root'. If you want to disable
notification via email just set admin to en empty string.
.TP
realtime = <yes|no>
If set to yes watchdog will lock itself into memory so it is never swapped
out.
.TP
priority = <schedule priority>
Set the schedule priority for realtime mode.
